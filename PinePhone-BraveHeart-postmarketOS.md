# Introduction

I'm trying to set up postmarketOS on the new PinePhone. Given that it has not arrived yet, this will just be preliminary stuff for now...

# Preparation

Working off the postmarketOS [wiki](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Installation_guide).

## Installing pmbootstrap

Needs a console on a working linux/VM somewhere.

`pip3 install --user pmbootstrap`
